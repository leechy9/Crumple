# Crumple #

## Overview ##

Crumple is a simple drop-in WSGI framework written in Python.

The documentation can be viewed by opening the file 'documentation.html' in a
web browser or accessed online at [Github.io](http://leechy9.github.io/Crumple)

It is highly recommended that users read the documentation provided with this 
software, since it covers setup, configuration, an overview, and examples. In
addition to the documentation, there are a few example files included in the
`extensions`, `templates`, and `pages` directories.

## Contributing ##

For developers who want to modify Crumple, most test cases should be covered 
in the example provided. A full suite of tests can be accessed at the page
`test/full_test`.

## Requirements ##

Crumple relies on Python (version 2.7 or higher) and a WSGI server. While 
this project has only been tested with mod_wsgi, it should work on other WSGI 
compliant servers.
