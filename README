Crumple is a simple WSGI template engine written in Python that allows for the
creation of modular websites.

It is highly recommended that users read the documentation provided with this 
software, since it covers setup, configuration, an overview, and examples. In
addition to the documentation, there are a few example files included in the
'extensions', 'templates', and 'pages' directories.

For developers who want to modify Crumple, most test cases should be covered in the example files mentioned above. A more thorough suite of tests has been included in 'extensions/test/' and 'templates/test/'. Accessing the page titled 'test.py' will provide tests for user inputs.

Crumple relies on Python (version 2.6 or higher), mod_wsgi, and Apache. While 
this project has only been tested with mod_wsgi, it should work on other WSGI 
compliant servers; there are future plans to test Crumple on uWSGI.

This software, its documentation, and the examples given are all released
under the GNU GPLv3 license.
