Crumple is a simple template engine written in Python that allows for the
creation of modular websites. It uses WSGI to interface with a web server.

The documentation can be viewed by opening the file 'documentation.html' in a
web browser or accessed online at http://leechy9.github.io/Crumple .

It is highly recommended that users read the documentation provided with this 
software, since it covers setup, configuration, an overview, and examples. In
addition to the documentation, there are a few example files included in the
'extensions', 'templates', and 'pages' directories.

For developers who want to modify Crumple, most test cases should be covered 
in the example files mentioned above. A more thorough suite of tests has been
included in 'extensions/test/' and 'templates/test/'. Accessing the page titled
'test.py' will provide tests for user inputs.

Crumple relies on Python (version 2.6 or higher), mod_wsgi, and Apache. While 
this project has only been tested with mod_wsgi, it should work on other WSGI 
compliant servers; there are future plans to test Crumple on uWSGI.

This software, its documentation, and the examples given are all released
under the GNU GPLv3 license.
